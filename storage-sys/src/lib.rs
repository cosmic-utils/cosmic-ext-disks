//! Low-level system operations for storage management
//!
//! This crate provides direct system call interfaces for operations that
//! don't go through D-Bus, such as:
//! - File descriptor management
//! - Direct file I/O for disk imaging
//! - Process management utilities
//! - RClone CLI operations
//!
//! These operations require elevated privileges and should only be called
//! from privileged services (like storage-service).
